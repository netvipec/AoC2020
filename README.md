# AoC2020

Solution for advent of code 2020.

Trying to solve the problems in the minutes that they came out.

-Programming done in Manjaro Linux, with gcc v10.2.0 and compilation flags.
`g++ -std=c++17 -Wshadow -Wall -o main main.cpp -g -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG`

-When compiling in release we use the flags:
`g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -o main main.cpp`

All the problems expect to receive the input throught the standard input.
